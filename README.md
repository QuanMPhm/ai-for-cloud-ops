# ai-for-cloud-ops

BU faculty members Ayse Coskun, Alan Liu, and Gianluca Stringhini, along with Red Hat researcher Marcel Hild will pursue work at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud systems through this joint project, ai-for-cloud-ops. 

The researchers intend to create new methods for fusing and representing systems data to enable AI-based analytics and will build, apply, and scale AI frameworks to improve performance, management, security, compliance, and resilience problems in the cloud. 


>"We aim to help deliver easily-accessible and open source AI technologies that will cater to both developers and administrators solving real-world performance, resilience, and security challenges”
