As an undergraduate researcher in the AI-for-cloud-ops collaborative project between Boston University and Red Hat. I was tasked with developing a plugin for the Jupyter IDE that would automatically detect deprecated or vulnerable Python in a Python program at runtime. The plugin uses the previously developed Praxi machine-learning algorithm to discover deprecated packages, and I was specifically tasked to create a pipeline infrastructure that would periodically train the algorithm, and have the algorithm be available to developers as a ML-as-a-Service application.

To this end, I used Docker, CouchDB, and various other tools to develop a prototype pipeline. While not fully functional, my participation has improved my understanding of cloud computing and Python.
