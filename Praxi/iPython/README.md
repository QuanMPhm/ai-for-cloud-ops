# iPython Magic Extension

### Architecture

## iPython Magic
There are many python lsp server implementations, and for the first experimental extension, we used cookiecutter and PyLS. Please refer to the [Python LSP server Github Page](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server) and [Cookiecutter Pylsp Github Page](https://github.com/python-lsp/cookiecutter-pylsp-plugin).

## Foundational Work
One of the project that form the foundation of the *AI for Cloud Ops* initiative is Praxi. Please refer to the project README for more information. For this specific method of implementation, we are using the Language Server Protocol (LSP) and for

### Ipython Magic
The Language Server Protocol (LSP) defines the protocol used between an editor or IDE and a language server. Please refer to [Official LSP Website](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) for more information.

## Current Work
Peac_LS is being worked on in parallel to *iPython magic implementation* method of implementation. Currently, an example of a working plugin is made by using PyLS and cookiecutter. Ideally, we would like to create our very own working Language Server.
