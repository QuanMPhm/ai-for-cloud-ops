## Python LSP Server
There are many python lsp server implementations, and for the first experimental extension, we used cookiecutter and PyLS. Please refer to the [Python LSP server Github Page](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server) and [Cookiecutter Pylsp Github Page](https://github.com/python-lsp/cookiecutter-pylsp-plugin).
